# Speech_Tune_Prediction
Speech tone prediction is the part of speech recognition that is gaining more popularity and its need is increasing greatly. While there are methods to detect tones using machine learning techniques, this project attempts to use deep learning to infer tones from voice data.

# Dataset Information
These data were made from three type of Tune:
*   Confident
*   Nervous
*   Neutral
*   NePublicSpeaking

There are a total of 600 voice audio data files produced by male and female speakers from different IELTS video and PublicSpeaking. The audio file format is a .WAV format.
